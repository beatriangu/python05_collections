# Python Module 05 – Collections

This module is part of a structured Python learning path focused on
writing clear, robust and explainable Python code.

The goal of this module is to understand and apply Python’s core
collection types to model and manipulate data effectively.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Understand when to use lists, tuples, sets and dictionaries
- Choose the appropriate data structure for a given problem
- Apply common collection operations confidently
- Write readable and maintainable data-oriented code
- Explain data structure choices during review

---

## 🧠 Topics covered

- Lists and sequential data
- Tuples and immutability
- Sets and uniqueness
- Dictionaries and key-value relationships
- Iteration over collections

---

## 🧪 Exercises overview

### Exercise 0 – Working with lists  
**Focus:** Sequential data and indexing

### Exercise 1 – Tuples and immutability  
**Focus:** Fixed data structures and safety

### Exercise 2 – Sets and uniqueness  
**Focus:** Deduplication and set operations

### Exercise 3 – Dictionaries  
**Focus:** Mapping data and fast lookups

### Exercise 4 – Choosing the right collection  
**Focus:** Selecting data structures based on constraints

---

## 🧩 Design principles

- Data structure choice before implementation
- Clarity over clever solutions
- One responsibility per function
- Explicit and readable iteration
- Learning-oriented solutions aligned with the subject

---

## 🛠️ Technical constraints

- Python 3.10+
- flake8 compliant
- Standard library only
- Clear separation between logic and execution
- Use of `main()` when applicable

---

## 📌 Notes

This module focuses on thinking in terms of data modeling.
Understanding how data is structured is a prerequisite for writing
efficient, readable and maintainable Python programs.
